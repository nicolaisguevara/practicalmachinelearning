Project to predict activity quality of lifting exercises

Recently, using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is possible to collect data about personal activity. In this project, we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. Our task is to predict the activity quality of these participants. The data is from the website http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. For more information about the project, please take a look at the html file in this repository.
